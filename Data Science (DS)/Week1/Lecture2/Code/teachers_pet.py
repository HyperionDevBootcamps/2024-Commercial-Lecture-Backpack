# Create a simple program which accepts the marks of a number of students
# and performs various functions on the dataset using for and while loops.

# Use a dictionary to store the names of the students and their marks



# Use a list to just store the marks of the students



# Calculate the average of the entered marks



# Display an ordered list of marks



# Adjust the marks by a set amount (grade on a curve)
